                                        she certainly wouldn’t have said: “in the coffee industry.”
                                        And initially, she would’ve been right. Because after she earned her graphic
                                        design degree, she applied her skills exactly where she expected to: in the
                                        creative industry. But instead of a sturdy foundation on which she could build a
                                        successful career, Braun was faced with competition and constant change. During
                                        these tumultuous times, she found comfort in warm cups of coffee and the
                                        inviting cafés where she enjoyed them.
                                        Coffee, Braun realized, was her rock. So, she jumped off her expected course in
                                        favor of a fresh start. Though the thought of giving up everything to become a
                                        barista petrified her, in the end, she knew having a career she was passionate
                                        about mattered more than anything. And in the end, growth in her career proves
                                        that this risk was one worth taking. She still uses her graphic design skills in
                                        her role as marketing coordinator, but she now gets to collaborate with the
                                        darers and daydreamers that fill the café industry. </p>
